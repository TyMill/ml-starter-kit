# Machine Learning Cheatsheet Repository

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Cheatsheet Repository** – a structured collection of short, practical tutorials and summaries of popular ML algorithms.  
Each algorithm comes with a separate folder containing:

- `README.md` – description, theory, use cases, pros & cons
- `tutorial.ipynb` – a Jupyter Notebook with hands-on code examples
- `references.md` – useful links, documentation, and papers

We provide materials in **two languages**:
- [`pl/`](./pl/) – Polish version  
- [`eng/`](./eng/) – English version
